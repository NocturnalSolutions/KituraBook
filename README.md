This book is dedicated to Commodore International and the team behind the Commodore 64, the little brown-and-tan wedge that made me the hopeless nerd I am today. Big thanks also go out to the intelligent, kind, and patient people on the Swift@IBM Slack server and the lovable curmudgeons in the Freenode #iphonedev-chat channel.
